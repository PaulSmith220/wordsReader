Allows you to download your file with "-" delimiter, for example:
```
to pick up - подбирать
to draw - рисовать
nightmare - кошмар
```

The app allows you to run auto-reading mode or read words by selecting them manually. It remembers your last position and starts from it next time you start the app.

You can swap the direction of translation at any time.

You can also choose from voice packs installed on your Mac to read different languages with different voices. You can install more languages & voice packs in "System Preferences" -> "Accessibility" -> "Speech" -> "System voice"
